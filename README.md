# STF_DTW
DTW clustering of earthquake source time functions. 

Those codes are to reproduce the results and figures in the manuscript "Source time function clustering reveals patterns in earthquake dynamics" by J. Yin, Z. Li and M. A. Denolle. The manuscript has been submitted to AGU Advances. Pre-print is available here: https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10503349.1


For results reproduction, directly run Main_run_SCARDEC.m and Main_run_Simulation.m in Matlab. Parameter settings and details can be found in the comments of those two scripts.
